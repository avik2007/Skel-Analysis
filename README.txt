Correlation Length has issues
because of EndingNodes and StartingNodes
 - EndingNodes uses skel to judge sizes so for postabaqus processing
it needs to be changed

Things that may be unnecessary:
 findShortestPathLength	
 findGeodesicVector
 findGeodesicMatrix




WE NEED A PIPELINE FOR 
A> preabaqus processing
B> postabaqus processing
